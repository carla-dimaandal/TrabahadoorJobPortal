## Project Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study was developed for the Persons with Disabilities Affairs Office (PDAO) Batangas by digitalizing some of their employment recruitment process using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. The system facilitates job recruitment by providing application forms, job seeker and employer lists, and an admin dashboard that delivers comprehensive analytics about the system and its demographics. The system matches job seekers and companies by displaying job profiles and resumes, as well as showcasing open employment  opportunities for people with disabilities.

## Sustainable Development Goal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TrabahaDoor is anchored on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, specifically 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value. With TrabahaDoor, the community can have a stepping stone towards achieving full and productive employment, offering PWDs the opportunity to access decent work that was once beyond their reach.

## Objectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of this project is to develop an online job portal to establish a more accessible and effective virtual job recruitment platform for the PWD Affairs Office Batangas (PDAO). 
	Specifically, it aims to:
Develop a website that would showcase the occupational profiles of individuals with disabilities, and the diverse range of career opportunities and organizations accepting PWDs.

Contribute to an easier selection of candidates for employers through features that include:
      3.1 Registering an employer account
