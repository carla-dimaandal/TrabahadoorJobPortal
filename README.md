## Project Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study was developed for the Persons with Disabilities Affairs Office (PDAO) Batangas by digitalizing some of their employment recruitment process using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. The system facilitates job recruitment by providing application forms, job seeker and employer lists, and an admin dashboard that delivers comprehensive analytics about the system and its demographics. The system matches job seekers and companies by displaying job profiles and resumes, as well as showcasing open employment  opportunities for people with disabilities.
